R code to fit contact matrices under symmetry constraint

This repository contains R function and object definitions to fit age-stratified contact matrices from survey data of social contacts in multiple locations under the constraint that total of the contacts between age groups is symmetrical. Estimation is achieved by maximizing a composite likelihood assuming a negative binomial distribution for the contacts in each location, following Mossong, J., et al., Social contacts and mixing patterns relevant to the spread of infectious diseases. PLoS Med, 2008. 5(3): p. e74, while imposing the symetry constraint.

The code is in development and documentation is currently incomplete.
